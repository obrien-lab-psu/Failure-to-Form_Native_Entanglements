# Benchmarking C-alpha coarse grianed models on ROAR COLLAB cluster PSU
Here I benchmark 10 100ns trajectories running at 310K of an already built CG model of pyruvate kinase 1 (470 amino acids).  


### Usage of [EntanglementsAndEssentiality.py](src/data/EntanglementsAndEssentiality.py)
```

```

If you have the [SLUG] then you can use the command files located [here](src/command_lists/EntanglementsAndEssentiality.cmds) to reproduce the Fisher exact test done on both the sets of experimental and alphafold data in this work.
